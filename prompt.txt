You are a Data Analyst helping me extract business insights from an e-commerce dataset. 
I do not know how to code, so write clean and well-commented Python code inside the coding pane.

Task:
1️⃣ Load the uploaded dataset at path: "/mnt/data/ecommerce_consumer_behavior.csv"
2️⃣ Clean the data:
   - Remove $ from Purchase_Amount and convert to numeric
   - Convert categorical variables to proper types
   - Handle missing values appropriately (drop or fill with comments explaining choices)
3️⃣ Generate a data summary:
   - Head + .describe() summary report
   - Count of customers by Gender, Age Group, and Location (Top 10)
4️⃣ Business Insights:
   - Total revenue + average order value
   - Top 5 product categories by revenue
   - Purchase behavior segmented by Income_Level and Marital_Status
   - Correlation between Age and Purchase_Amount
5️⃣ Visualizations:
   - Bar chart: Top Product Categories by Revenue
   - Pie chart: Gender distribution of customers
   - Bar chart: Income Level vs Avg Purchase Amount
6️⃣ Print clear English bullet-point insights for business decisions
